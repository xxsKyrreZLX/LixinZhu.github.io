                    <h3>Interactive Media</h3>
                    <p>This an interactive snow material that dynamically deforms with footprints by rendering a height map. The system uses a Render Target as a canvas to capture foot patterns via ray tracing and applies them to the snow surface in real time. To handle large scenes, the canvas moves with the character, preserving footprints and fading distant ones. Snow buildup is simulated by blurring footprints, generating a height map to represent depth. Realistic lighting and terrain displacement are achieved using normal maps and Virtual Heightfield Mesh.</p>
